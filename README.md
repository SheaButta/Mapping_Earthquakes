# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to assist my client with producing map visualizations using specific data sets related to JSON or GeoJSON. Thus far I have assited my client with producing an earthquake map with two different maps and an earthquake overlay.  My client is now interested seeing earthquake data in relation to the tectronic plates' location on the earth.  I have used various colors that will allow you to see the correlations between the map overlays.

My final sprint will include adding three (3) specific visualization which are identified below.  As always, my analysis followed the data analysis principles of (1) Determine the number of rows and columns; (2) Data types used; and (3) Is the data readable?

__Client Expected Results:__
- Visualize Techtronic Plates overlay
- Visualize Earthquakes overlay with magnitudes displayed by legend
- Visualize Major Earthquakes overlay with magnitudes displayed by legend
- Visualize all overlays with legend


## Resources
The resouces used for this JavaScript application included;
- Visual Studio Code
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- D3 (Data-Driven Documents)
- JSON dataset
- GeoJSON dataset
- Leaflet JavaScript Library


## Results
All sprints were completed as scheduled and I delivered on all client expectations/results.

__Deliverable 1:__ Visualize Techtronic Plates overlay

## Summary
My client is extremely pleased with the final sprint as we have proven the ability to read JSON and GeoJSON data and most importantly visualize the data using D3 (Data-Driven Documents) and the Leaflet JavaScript library.  One additional visualization that I performed was displaying a flight from LAX to JFK.  Along the way I also identified a stop at BWI.
